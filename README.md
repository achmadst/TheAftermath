# The Aftermath (WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2023 Submission)

Many people only see mathematics as a boring subject and think that mathematics has nothing to do with our lives. But I remember my high school teacher said that "If you study and master math, you will understand life". At first, I didn't know what it meant, but after majoring in math in college I think there are a lot of math concepts we can relate to in our lives.

So, I'd like to introduce one of my favorite equations that relate to a concept about life, it's called the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect is the idea that a small, seemingly trivial event can eventually produce something with far greater consequences. This idea was introduced by Edward Lorenz who discovered an unusual pattern while researching the weather. Then Lorenz made a model of the system with three nonlinear differential equations to describe this, the model is known as the Lorenz Attractor. These equations allow us to see random patterns depending on parameter changes, which is the essence of the butterfly effect.

I am creating an application that allows the user to see a visualization of the Lorenz Attractor equation. In this application, I use SwiftUI and SceneKit to create a visualization and animation of the equation. Users can also edit the values of the parameters which will change the visualization of the equation. I also use AVKit to add background music to add ambiance to the app.

By making this app I hope people can see mathematics from another side. I also want them to see math as something beautiful from the visualizations this app creates. Most importantly, I want to give encouragement to other people to be wise in their life. Because there is an aftermath to every action we do.

How To Run this Project:
1. Unzip The Aftermath.swiftpm file
2. Open The Aftermath.swiftpm on XCode or Swift Playground
3. Run it on your device
